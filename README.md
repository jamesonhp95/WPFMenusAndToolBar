# WPFMenusAndToolBar

Guide for Program;

Main Window: Intuitive buttons such as Add Selected items and add all items within display box.
Clear database below the adding buttons. Specify the path with a label tool tip.
Specify extension with a drop down menu available. Tool tip for examples.

Database Form: Intuitive buttons including 'Specify Extension to Query' with a textbox to the right of it.
'Specify File Name to Query' with a textbox to the right of it for input.
'Specify Event to Query' with a textbox to the right of it for input.
All of these REQUIRE information to be typed into their respective input boxes.
Below Display box is a remove selected button and a remove all button. These
work mechanically the same way as the add buttons in the main window, however with reversed outcome.
