Regarding Extra Credit;
1) Allowed for the user to remove selected entries or add selected entries from each
individual display box rather than all or nothing.
2) Allowed user to specify the path for monitoring.

Note - In terms of difficulty, number 1 was by far more taxing. Allowing
the user to specify the path was nothing new, and part of me thought about not including it
but wasn't sure and didn't see it as a requirement in the write-up. That said I enjoyed
this assignment!
