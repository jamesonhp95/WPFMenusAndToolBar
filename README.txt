Guide for Program;

Main Window: Intuitive buttons such as Add Selected items and add all items within display box.
Clear database below the adding buttons. Specify the path with a label tool tip.
Specify extension with a drop down menu available. Tool tip for examples.

Database Form: Intuitive buttons including 'Specify Extension to Query' with a textbox to the right of it.
'Specify File Name to Query' with a textbox to the right of it for input.
'Specify Event to Query' with a textbox to the right of it for input.
All of these REQUIRE information to be typed into their respective input boxes.
Below Display box is a remove selected button and a remove all button. These
work mechanically the same way as the add buttons in the main window, however with reversed outcome.


Regarding Extra Credit;
1) Allowed for the user to remove selected entries or add selected entries from each
individual display box rather than all or nothing.
2) Allowed user to specify the path for monitoring.

Note - In terms of difficulty, number 1 was by far more taxing. Allowing
the user to specify the path was nothing new, and part of me thought about not including it
but wasn't sure and didn't see it as a requirement in the write-up. That said I enjoyed
this assignment!
